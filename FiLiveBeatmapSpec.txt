FiLive! Beatmap File Specification
Extension: *.fim
           *.fi
           *.flm is also acceptable, but it's used by FL Studio Mobile by Image-Line.
Still subject to change!

Datatypes (little endian):
* byte   - 1 byte (C char datatype). "
* word   - 2 bytes (C short datatype). "
* dword  - 4 bytes (C int datatype). "
* sfloat - 4 bytes, floating point (C float datatype).
* dfloat - 8 bytes, floating point (C double datatype).
* varint - variable-length integer. MIDI-like encoding.
* string - variable-length string. First unsigned dword is string length in bytes followed by the data.
" Default to unsigned, 2s complement, unless stated otherwise.

File header start:
dword  - Header ("Fi!M", stands for "FiLive! beatMap")
byte   - Version (1 at the moment)
byte   - Background ID (or 0 to use default)
byte   - Note style (1, 2, or 3 for normal, neon, and matte respectively. 0 for default)
string - Beatmapper name (can be empty)
string - Song name
string - Song information (lyrics, composition, arrangement string)

Fi!Live beatmap consist of chunk (seamlessly stolen from PNG), where each chunk are defined as:
dword  - Chunk FourCC
string - Data
dword  - zlib CRC32 of Data above, including the chunk FourCC and the data length

All implementation must understand and successfully decode critical chunk (all uppercase).
Very simple FiLive! beatmap decoder must support minimal BMAP and FEND chunk!

Ancillary chunks (lowercase in first character) can be ignored by decoder if decoder
doesn't know how to interpret it.

Summary, Fi!Live Beatmap file format consist of:
[File Header] + [Chunk] + [Chunk] + ... + [FEND Chunk]

Now list of chunks:
* BMAP - Beatmap (can appear multiple times for different difficulty)
  byte   - Compression. If it's 0, then the data below is uncompressed.
           * If it's 0x78, then it's zlib compressed
           * If it's 0x1F, then it's gzip compressed
  dword  - Uncompressed length of all data below.
  string - Difficulty string
  byte   - Difficulty star
  byte   - Difficulty star (random variant; 0 to get from previous value)
  dword  - Score needed for C score
  dword  - Score needed for B score
  dword  - Score needed for A score
  dword  - Score needed for S score
  dword  - Combo needed for C combo
  dword  - Combo needed for B combo
  dword  - Combo needed for A combo
  dword  - Combo needed for S combo
  dword  - Amount of notes
  For every notes by "Amount of notes":
    sfloat - Note timing in seconds
    dwordu - Attribute. Bit layout: rrrrrrrr rggggggg ggbbbbbb bbbccccc
             * bit 0-4 (c): Note images following Sukufesu simulator note colors in order. Ask yuyu for it, lol.
             * If all bits 0-4 is 1 - Colored note
               * bit 23-31 - R color (9 bits, unsigned)
               * bit 14-22 - G color (9 bits, unsigned)
               * bit 5-13  - B color (9 bits, unsigned)
    dwordu - Physical note information. Bit layout: gggggggg gggggggg gggggggs vvffpppp
             * bit 0-3 - Position. 9 is leftmost, 1 is rightmost. Values outside that range are invalid.
             * bit 4-5 - Note effect
               * 0 = Normal note
               * 1 = Token note
               * 2 = Long note (bit 6-23 is the length, max 262.143 seconds or 262143 ms length)
               * 3 = Star note
             * bit 6-7 - Note visibility
               * 0 = Usual note
               * 1 = Hidden note
               * 2 = Sudden note
             * bit 8 - Is swing note? (cannot be applied to star note)
             * bit 9-31 - Note group (for swing). Can be 0
    sfloat - Note length (For long note. Default to 0 if not used). Zero-length long note is not a valid note.
    * If note data contains invalid value, skip the whole note data
  EndFor

* aDNM - Audio filename (can appear multiple times)
  string - Preferred audio filename

* aDDT - Audio data (can only appear once). Ignores aDNM if present.
  string - Audio extension, to let libav probe the format
  string - Audio data

* aVNS - Advanced note style setting
  byte - Frame note style ID
  byte - Simultaneous note style ID
  byte - Swing note style ID

* sRYL - Storyboard
  byte   - Compression. If it's 0, then the data below is uncompressed.
           * If it's 0x78, then it's zlib compressed
           * If it's 0x1F, then it's gzip compressed
  dword  - Uncompressed length of all data below.
  string - Storyboard script

* FEND - End of beatmap file (zero-length chunk)
  If this chunk does not appear in EOF that means beatmap is corrupted.
