Build instruction of livesim4 for MSVC (Windows)

Requirements
------------
* MSVC 1800 (VS2013) or later - For building the whole project
* CMake v3.1 or later - For building megasource
* MSYS - For building FFmpeg
* LOVE 0.10.2 - For the game
* FFmpeg 3.x - More audio/video support
* LVEP - More audio/video support (shipped)

Preparation
-----------
1. Download FFmpeg 3.x and extract it to `livesim4/ffmpeg`. Make sure there's `livesim4/ffmpeg/configure` there.
2. Clone Megasource to `livesim4/megasource
2. Clone LOVE to `livesim4/src/love`

Build FFmpeg
------------
1. Navigate to `livesim4/ffmpeg`
2. Create `msvc` directory
3. Navigate to newly created `msvc` directory
4. $ ../configure --toolchain=msvc --enable-version3 --prefix=../../lib/ffmpeg/msvc --enable-shared --disable-static --disable-ffserver --disable-doc
5. $ make
6. $ make install
PS: For 64bit build, use ../../lib/ffmpeg/msvc/x64 prefix. Make sure to use different folder name like "msvc64" in step 2

Build Megasource
----------------
Follow megasource instructions, but specify "-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=livesim4/lib/mgs(/x64)" (add /x64 for 64bit build)
to CMake. Make sure to use "-Bbuild64" instead of "-Bbuild" for 64bit build.

Build LOVE & livesim4
---------------------
1. Open `sln/livesim4.sln` solution
2. Build

Notes
-----
The reason LOVE has to build along with the whole livesim4 is that because livesim4 uses LOVE C++ API directly, where
this is not possible if LOVE is configured along with megasource (the DLLs doesn't expose the LOVE C++ API)

This assume PhysFS 2.1 or later is used. If you're using 2.0, undefine "LOVE_USE_PHYSFS_2_1"

When building in my machine, I'm getting internal compiler error, so I have to modify
`livesim4/src/love/src/modules/joystick/sdl/joystick.h` line 111 to this
```
SDL_HapticEffect effect;
```
